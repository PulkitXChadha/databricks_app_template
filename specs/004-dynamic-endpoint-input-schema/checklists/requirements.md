# Specification Quality Checklist: Automatic Model Input Schema Detection

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 17, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

**Review Date**: October 17, 2025

**Findings**:

### Content Quality - PASSED
- ✅ Specification focuses on user needs (automatic schema detection to reduce errors and save time)
- ✅ No implementation-specific details (no mention of specific programming languages, frameworks, or code structure)
- ✅ Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders (business value clearly articulated)
- ✅ All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, Success Criteria

### Requirement Completeness - PASSED
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in the specification
- ✅ All requirements are testable (e.g., FR-001 "MUST detect endpoint type" can be verified by testing with known endpoint types)
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (e.g., SC-001 "within 500 milliseconds", SC-004 "reduce errors by 60%")
- ✅ Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focused on user outcomes: "see example populate", "reduce errors", "successful invoke")
- ✅ Acceptance scenarios follow Given-When-Then format with clear expectations
- ✅ Edge cases comprehensively identified (timeouts, complex schemas, ambiguous detection, malformed schemas)
- ✅ Scope is clearly bounded with three prioritized user stories (P1: foundation models, P2: MLflow models, P3: fallback)
- ✅ Dependencies explicitly listed (Model Registry API, Serving Endpoints API, Unity Catalog permissions)
- ✅ Assumptions documented (schema formats, API response times, user permissions)

### Feature Readiness - PASSED
- ✅ Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- ✅ User scenarios cover complete flow: endpoint selection → schema detection → example generation → validation → error handling
- ✅ Success criteria provide clear measurement targets for feature effectiveness
- ✅ No technical implementation details present in specification

## Notes

- Specification is ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`)
- All quality criteria met without requiring spec updates
- Feature scope is well-defined with clear priorities (P1 for foundation models as most common use case)
- Success metrics provide concrete targets for measuring feature effectiveness (60% error reduction, 80% first-attempt success rate)
