- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **No implementation details**: The specification focuses on WHAT needs to be tested (API endpoints, workflows, error scenarios) without specifying HOW to implement the tests (no mention of specific testing frameworks, libraries, or code structure).

✅ **Focused on user value**: All user stories explain the business value and risk mitigation from the developer/QA perspective - ensuring data isolation, preventing security vulnerabilities, catching bugs early.

✅ **Written for non-technical stakeholders**: User stories use plain language describing scenarios and outcomes. While technical terms like "API endpoints" are used, they're necessary for the domain and explained in context.

✅ **All mandatory sections completed**: All required sections (User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, Success Criteria) are present and fully populated.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers**: The specification makes informed decisions based on the existing codebase analysis. All test coverage areas are clearly defined.

✅ **Requirements are testable and unambiguous**: Each FR specifies exactly what integration tests must cover (specific endpoints, scenarios, behaviors). For example, "FR-001: System MUST provide integration tests for all Lakebase API endpoints (GET/POST/DELETE preferences) covering success and error cases" is concrete and verifiable.

✅ **Success criteria are measurable**: All SC items include specific metrics:
- SC-001: 90% endpoint coverage
- SC-003: Under 5 minutes execution time
- SC-004: Zero failures over 30 days
- SC-006: Add tests in under 30 minutes
- SC-007: 95% contract violation detection

✅ **Success criteria are technology-agnostic**: Success criteria focus on outcomes (coverage percentage, execution time, failure rates) rather than implementation details. No mention of specific testing tools or frameworks.

✅ **All acceptance scenarios are defined**: Each user story includes detailed Given-When-Then scenarios with test types and locations specified. Total of 40+ acceptance scenarios across 7 user stories.

✅ **Edge cases are identified**: Comprehensive edge case section covers boundary conditions, error scenarios, data validation, concurrency, and special characters.

✅ **Scope is clearly bounded**: Specification focuses specifically on integration tests to maximize coverage. It's bounded to:
- API endpoint testing (Lakebase, Unity Catalog, Model Serving, User)
- Cross-service workflows
- Error handling and resilience
- Pagination and concurrency
- Excludes unit tests and contract tests (those exist separately)

✅ **Dependencies and assumptions identified**: Dependencies are implicit but clear from user stories:
- Existing API endpoints must be functional
- Test environment with database access
- Mock services for external dependencies
- CI/CD pipeline for test execution

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria**: Each FR maps directly to user stories with detailed acceptance scenarios. For example, FR-001 (Lakebase tests) corresponds to User Story 1 with 7 detailed scenarios.

✅ **User scenarios cover primary flows**: The 7 user stories are prioritized (P1, P2, P3) and cover:
- P1: Core API coverage for all three main services
- P2: Cross-service integration and error recovery
- P3: Edge cases like pagination and concurrency

✅ **Feature meets measurable outcomes**: Success criteria (SC-001 through SC-008) define clear metrics for coverage, execution time, failure rates, and developer productivity that validate the feature's success.

✅ **No implementation details leak**: Specification maintains abstraction level appropriate for requirements. While it mentions test file names and pytest, these are organization conventions rather than implementation constraints.

## Notes

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for the next phase.

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive analysis of current codebase to identify coverage gaps
- Well-prioritized user stories with clear business value
- Detailed acceptance scenarios that can be directly converted to tests
- Measurable success criteria with specific targets
- Extensive edge case coverage

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` to create detailed task breakdown and implementation plan.
