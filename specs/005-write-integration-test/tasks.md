# Tasks: Comprehensive Integration Test Coverage

**Feature**: 005-write-integration-test  
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-write-integration-test/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úÖ, spec.md ‚úÖ, research.md ‚úÖ, data-model.md ‚úÖ, contracts/coverage-targets.yaml ‚úÖ

**TDD REQUIREMENT (Principle XII)**: This feature implements integration tests following Test Driven Development. Each test MUST be written to fail initially (RED), then implementation verified (GREEN), then refactored for quality (REFACTOR).

**IMPORTANT CONTEXT (C2 Clarification)**: The routers and services being tested (server/routers/*.py, server/services/*.py) were implemented in previous features (001-004). This feature adds comprehensive integration tests to validate existing code. Tests ARE the new implementation here. The GREEN phase verifies tests correctly validate the existing router/service implementations, not that we're writing routers after tests.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent test implementation and coverage validation per story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Test Infrastructure)

- [ ] T010 [P] Create cleanup fixture for schema detection events in tests/integration/conftest.py (autouse, function-scoped)
- [ ] T011 Create test data factory functions in tests/integration/conftest.py (create_test_preference, create_test_inference_log)
- [ ] T012 Add mock service patching utilities in tests/integration/conftest.py (mock_workspace_client, mock_lakebase_session)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story test implementation can now begin in parallel

- **User Story 1 (P1) - Lakebase**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1) - Unity Catalog**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P1) - Model Serving**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 4 (P2) - Cross-Service**: Can start after Foundational - Integrates US1, US2, US3 but tests independently
- **User Story 5 (P2) - Error Recovery**: Can start after Foundational - Tests across all services
- **User Story 6 (P3) - Pagination**: Can start after Foundational - Tests across all services
- **User Story 7 (P3) - Concurrency**: Can start after Foundational - Tests across all services

### Within Each User Story (TDD Phases)

**TDD Workflow (MANDATORY - Principle XII):**
1. **RED Phase**: Write all tests first - ALL MUST FAIL initially
2. **GREEN Phase**: Verify tests pass against existing implementation (routers/services already exist)
3. **REFACTOR Phase**: Improve test code quality while keeping tests GREEN

**Note**: For this feature, tests ARE the implementation. The routers and services being tested already exist, so the GREEN phase verifies tests correctly validate existing code.

**Implementation Order Within Each Phase:**
- RED: Write all test functions for the user story
- GREEN: Run tests, verify they pass against existing implementation
- REFACTOR: Improve test quality (fixtures, docstrings, readability)
- Verify coverage meets 90% threshold before moving to next story

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T005, T006, T007)
- All Foundational cleanup fixtures marked [P] can run in parallel (T009, T010)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories CAN start in parallel (if team capacity allows):
  - Developer A: User Story 1 (Lakebase tests)
  - Developer B: User Story 2 (Unity Catalog tests)
  - Developer C: User Story 3 (Model Serving tests)
  - etc.
- Within Polish phase, tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T109, T110, T113)

## Parallel Example: After Foundational Phase Complete

```bash
# All P1 user stories can start in parallel:

# Terminal 1: User Story 1 - Lakebase tests
cd tests/integration/
# Create test_lakebase_full_flow.py with 7 test scenarios

# Terminal 2: User Story 2 - Unity Catalog tests
cd tests/integration/
# Create test_unity_catalog_full_flow.py with 9 test scenarios

# Terminal 3: User Story 3 - Model Serving tests
cd tests/integration/
# Create test_model_serving_full_flow.py with 10 test scenarios
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1, 2, 3 - All P1)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (pytest-cov, fixtures)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (cleanup fixtures, test utilities) - **CRITICAL - blocks all stories**
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Lakebase tests)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Unity Catalog tests)
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (Model Serving tests)
6. **VALIDATE MVP**: Run coverage validation - ALL P1 APIs should have 90%+ coverage
7. Generate coverage reports and review gaps

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Test infrastructure ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Validate independently ‚Üí 90%+ coverage on Lakebase
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Validate independently ‚Üí 90%+ coverage on Unity Catalog
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Validate independently ‚Üí 90%+ coverage on Model Serving
5. **MVP CHECKPOINT** - All P1 APIs covered
6. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Validate cross-service workflows
7. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Validate error recovery
8. Add User Story 6 ‚Üí Validate pagination
9. Add User Story 7 ‚Üí Validate concurrency
10. Complete Polish phase ‚Üí Full test suite with 90%+ overall coverage

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (Phases 1-2)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Lakebase - 7 tests)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Unity Catalog - 9 tests)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Model Serving - 10 tests)
3. After P1 stories complete:
   - Developer A: User Story 4 (Cross-service - 4 tests)
   - Developer B: User Story 5 (Error recovery - 4 tests)
   - Developer C: User Story 6 (Pagination - 4 tests) + User Story 7 (Concurrency - 4 tests)
4. Team completes Polish phase together

## Common Refactor Checklist (M6 Reference)

**Purpose**: Standard refactoring improvements that apply to ALL user story REFACTOR phases to avoid task duplication.

**Use this checklist for tasks T024-T027, T041-T043, T059-T062, T071-T073, T082-T084, T093-T095, T104-T106:**

1. **Extract Common Patterns**
   - Move repeated setup/teardown logic into class-level or module-level fixtures
   - Create helper functions for common assertion patterns
   - Consolidate mock setup into reusable fixtures

2. **Documentation**
   - Add docstrings to all test functions using Given-When-Then format
   - Document complex test scenarios with inline comments
   - Add module-level docstrings explaining test file purpose

3. **Improve Readability**
   - Use descriptive variable names (avoid generic `data`, `result`, `response`)
   - Break complex test logic into smaller helper functions
   - Add assertion messages for better failure diagnostics

4. **Remove Duplication**
   - Identify repeated mock configurations and extract to fixtures
   - Consolidate similar test scenarios using parametrization
   - Share test data factories across test files

5. **Verify Quality**
   - Run tests after each refactoring step to ensure GREEN
   - Check coverage remains at 90%+ after refactoring
   - Validate test execution time hasn't increased significantly

**Reminder**: All refactoring MUST keep tests GREEN. Run `pytest <test_file> -v` after each change.

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **[Story] label** maps task to specific user story for traceability (US1, US2, US3, etc.)
- **Tests ARE the implementation** for this feature - write comprehensive integration tests
- **TDD MANDATORY** (Principle XII): Always follow RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle
  - RED: Write test first, verify it FAILS (no implementation yet OR incorrect implementation)
  - GREEN: Verify test passes against existing router/service implementation
  - REFACTOR: Improve test code quality while keeping tests GREEN
- **Coverage target**: 90% minimum for server/routers/ and server/services/ (SC-001)
- **Performance target**: Full test suite under 5 minutes (SC-003)
- **Each user story is independently completable and testable**
- Commit after each TDD phase (RED, GREEN, REFACTOR) or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate coverage independently
- Run coverage reports frequently to identify gaps
- Focus on critical paths and edge cases (don't aim for 100% coverage)
